# Matlab Equivalent Functions in Scilab
---

This repository will host Matlab functions that do not exist in Scilab, which users can easily implement in their codes.

All these functions can be tested both in the [Downloadable Desktop Version](https://www.scilab.org/download) and in the [Online Version](https://cloud.scilab.in/) of Scilab.
